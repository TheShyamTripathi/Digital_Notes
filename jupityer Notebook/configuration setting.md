If Jupyter Notebook is opening in VS Code instead of your web browser, you can change the default behavior by modifying the Jupyter configuration. Here's how you can set it to open in your preferred browser:

### Method 1: Update Jupyter Configuration
1. **Generate a Jupyter configuration file** (if you haven't already):
   - Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```
     jupyter notebook --generate-config
     ```
   - This will create a configuration file named `jupyter_notebook_config.py` in your home directory under `.jupyter`.

2. **Locate and edit the configuration file**:
   - Open the configuration file. You can find it typically at:
     ```
     ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
     ```
   - Use any text editor to open this file.

3. **Change the browser setting**:
   - Search for the line that contains `#c.NotebookApp.browser = ''`.
   - Uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the beginning, and set the path to your preferred browser. For example:
     ```python
     c.NotebookApp.browser = 'chrome'  # Or use 'firefox', 'safari', etc.
     ```
   - If you want to specify the path to the browser directly, you can do so like this:
     ```python
     c.NotebookApp.browser = '/usr/bin/google-chrome'
     ```

4. **Restart Jupyter Notebook**:
   - After saving the changes, restart Jupyter Notebook, and it should now open in your specified browser.

### Method 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook with Browser Option
You can also specify the browser directly when launching Jupyter Notebook from the terminal:
```bash
jupyter notebook --browser=chrome
```
Replace `chrome` with your preferred browser's name.

After making these changes, Jupyter Notebook should open in your web browser instead of VS Code. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
