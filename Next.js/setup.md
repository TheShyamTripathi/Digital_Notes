The error you're encountering (`ENOENT: no such file or directory`) suggests that npm is unable to find the required directories, most likely because the path `C:\Users\Shyam\AppData\Roaming\npm` doesn't exist or isn't accessible.

Here are steps to fix this issue:

### 1. **Check npm and Node.js installation**
   Ensure that both npm and Node.js are properly installed and accessible from your system. You can check this by running:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   If either of these commands returns an error or is not recognized, reinstall Node.js from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), which will install npm as well.

### 2. **Manually create the missing directory**
   If npm is installed but the directory is missing, create the directory manually:
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\Shyam\AppData\Roaming\`.
   - Create a folder named `npm` if it doesn't already exist.

### 3. **Clear npm cache**
   Sometimes clearing the npm cache can resolve issues. Run:
   ```
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

### 4. **Set a custom npm global path**
   You can set npm to use a different global directory if the current one has permission issues:
   1. Create a folder where npm packages will be installed, for example:
      ```
      mkdir C:\Users\Shyam\npm-global
      ```
   2. Configure npm to use this folder for global installations:
      ```
      npm config set prefix "C:\Users\Shyam\npm-global"
      ```
   3. Add this new path to your system environment variable:
      - Open System Properties > Environment Variables.
      - Find `Path` in user variables, and add `C:\Users\Shyam\npm-global\bin`.

### 5. **Re-run the command**
   After these changes, try running the command again:
   ```
   npx create-next-app@latest
   ```
