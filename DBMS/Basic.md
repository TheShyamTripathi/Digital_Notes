To clear the MySQL command-line interface screen, you can use the following command:

```sql
system clear
```

This command will clear the terminal screen and give you a clean slate to work with. Note that `system clear` works on Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS). If you're using Windows, you might need to use the `cls` command:

```sql
system cls
```
