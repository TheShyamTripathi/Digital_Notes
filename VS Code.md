When you run Git commands in VS Code, and the Vim editor opens (which is common for Git in the terminal), you can use the following basic Vim commands to edit your commit message:

### Basic Vim Commands:

1. **Insert Mode (to start editing):**
   - Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode**. This allows you to start typing and editing the commit message.

2. **Saving Changes:**
   - After editing, press `Esc` to exit Insert Mode.
   - Then, type `:w` and press `Enter`. This writes (saves) the file.

3. **Quitting Vim:**
   - To quit after saving, type `:q` and press `Enter`.

4. **Save and Quit Together:**
   - You can also save and quit in one command by typing `:wq` and pressing `Enter`.

5. **Quit Without Saving:**
   - If you made a mistake and want to exit without saving, type `:q!` and press `Enter`.

### Examples:

- **Entering Insert Mode:**
  - Press `i` and then start typing the commit message.

- **Saving and Quitting:**
  - After editing, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and hit `Enter`.

- **Quitting Without Saving:**
  - If you decide not to change the commit message, press `Esc`, type `:q!`, and hit `Enter`.

These basic commands should help you navigate Vim when it opens in your terminal within VS Code. If you'd prefer not to use Vim, you can change the default Git editor to something else (like Nano or VS Code itself), but that's another topic. Let me know if you need more details!
