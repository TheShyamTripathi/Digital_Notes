When you run Git commands in VS Code, and the Vim editor opens (which is common for Git in the terminal), you can use the following basic Vim commands to edit your commit message:

### Basic Vim Commands:

1. **Insert Mode (to start editing):**
   - Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode**. This allows you to start typing and editing the commit message.

2. **Saving Changes:**
   - After editing, press `Esc` to exit Insert Mode.
   - Then, type `:w` and press `Enter`. This writes (saves) the file.

3. **Quitting Vim:**
   - To quit after saving, type `:q` and press `Enter`.

4. **Save and Quit Together:**
   - You can also save and quit in one command by typing `:wq` and pressing `Enter`.

5. **Quit Without Saving:**
   - If you made a mistake and want to exit without saving, type `:q!` and press `Enter`.

### Examples:

- **Entering Insert Mode:**
  - Press `i` and then start typing the commit message.

- **Saving and Quitting:**
  - After editing, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and hit `Enter`.

- **Quitting Without Saving:**
  - If you decide not to change the commit message, press `Esc`, type `:q!`, and hit `Enter`.

These basic commands should help you navigate Vim when it opens in your terminal within VS Code. If you'd prefer not to use Vim, you can change the default Git editor to something else (like Nano or VS Code itself), but that's another topic. Let me know if you need more details!

It seems like you're encountering an issue where Vim is indicating that the file is read-only due to the `readonly` option being set. This often happens when you try to edit a commit message or file that Git has opened in a protected mode.

To resolve this and edit the commit message in Vim, you can override the `readonly` option by following these steps:

1. **Override Read-Only Mode:**
   - After making your changes to the commit message, press `Esc` to ensure you're in command mode.
   - Then, type the following command to override the `readonly` option and force-save the file:
     ```
     :wq!
     ```
   - This command saves the file and quits Vim, even if it was originally read-only.

2. **If You Havenâ€™t Made Changes Yet:**
   - Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode**, make the necessary changes to your commit message, and then use the `:wq!` command as mentioned above.

### Explanation:
- `:wq!`: This command writes (saves) the changes to the file and quits Vim. The `!` overrides the `readonly` setting, allowing you to save the changes even if the file is marked as read-only.

This should help you proceed with editing and saving the commit message. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!
