A **header guard** in C (and C++) is a mechanism used to prevent a header file from being included multiple times in a single compilation, which can cause errors such as redefinition of variables, functions, or types.

A header guard is implemented using preprocessor directives (`#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif`) in the header file. These directives check if a unique identifier has been defined before, and if not, they define it and include the content of the header file. This ensures that the header file is included only once.

### Example of a header guard:

```c
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H   // Check if MY_HEADER_H is not defined
#define MY_HEADER_H   // Define MY_HEADER_H

// Header file content goes here

void myFunction();

#endif // End of header guard
```

### How it works:
1. **`#ifndef MY_HEADER_H`**: This checks if `MY_HEADER_H` (a unique identifier for this file) has been defined. If it hasn't, the preprocessor moves to the next line.
2. **`#define MY_HEADER_H`**: This defines the identifier `MY_HEADER_H`. It tells the preprocessor that the file is now included, so next time the file is included, the `#ifndef` check will fail.
3. **Header content**: The actual declarations (functions, variables, etc.) are placed between the `#define` and `#endif`.
4. **`#endif`**: This marks the end of the header guard.

### Why are header guards important?
If a header file is included multiple times in the same file, it can lead to multiple definitions of the same function, variable, or type, causing compilation errors. Header guards prevent this by ensuring the content of the header file is processed only once.

### Without header guards:

```c
// my_header.h
void myFunction();
```

```c
// main.c
#include "my_header.h"
#include "my_header.h"  // included twice by mistake

int main() {
    myFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

In this case, without header guards, the function `myFunction()` is declared twice, leading to an error. Using header guards avoids this issue.




To break your C code into separate files and organize it better, you can create a header file for the function declarations and a separate implementation file for the function definitions. You'll then include the header file in your `main.c`. Here's the complete procedure and an example.

### Steps to Organize Your Code:

1. **Create a header file (`functions.h`)**: This file will contain the function declarations (prototypes) and use header guards.
2. **Create a source file (`functions.c`)**: This file will contain the actual function definitions (implementation).
3. **Modify your `main.c` file**: Include the header file so that the functions can be used in `main.c`.

### Step-by-Step Example:

#### 1. `functions.h` (Header file with function declarations and header guards)

```c
#ifndef FUNCTIONS_H   // Header guard start
#define FUNCTIONS_H   // Define the header guard

// Function declarations (prototypes)
void function1();
void function2();
void function3();
void function4();
void function5();
// Add more function declarations as needed

#endif  // Header guard end
```

- **`#ifndef FUNCTIONS_H`**: Checks if `FUNCTIONS_H` has been defined. If not, it proceeds.
- **`#define FUNCTIONS_H`**: Defines `FUNCTIONS_H` to ensure the file is only included once.
- The function declarations are placed inside the guard to avoid multiple inclusions.

#### 2. `functions.c` (Implementation file with function definitions)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "functions.h"  // Include the header file for function declarations

// Function implementations
void function1() {
    printf("Function 1 executed.\n");
}

void function2() {
    printf("Function 2 executed.\n");
}

void function3() {
    printf("Function 3 executed.\n");
}

void function4() {
    printf("Function 4 executed.\n");
}

void function5() {
    printf("Function 5 executed.\n");
}

// Add more function implementations as needed
```

- Here, the header file `functions.h` is included so that the compiler knows these functions are declared and available in other files.
- You can add as many function definitions as needed in this file.

#### 3. `main.c` (Main file to use the functions)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "functions.h"  // Include the header file

int main() {
    // Call the functions
    function1();
    function2();
    function3();
    function4();
    function5();
    
    return 0;
}
```

- In `main.c`, you include `functions.h` to make the function declarations available to the main program.
- Now, you can call any of the functions defined in `functions.c`.

### How to Compile and Link Multiple Files

When you're working with multiple `.c` files, you need to compile them together. You can do this using a compiler like `gcc`.

```bash
gcc main.c functions.c -o my_program
```

- **`main.c`**: Your main program file.
- **`functions.c`**: The file containing your function implementations.
- **`-o my_program`**: Specifies the output file name (you can call it whatever you like).

### Running the Program:

After compilation, run the program:

```bash
./my_program
```

### Expected Output:

```
Function 1 executed.
Function 2 executed.
Function 3 executed.
Function 4 executed.
Function 5 executed.
```

---

### Summary of Files:

- **`functions.h`**: Header file containing function declarations and a header guard.
- **`functions.c`**: Source file containing function implementations.
- **`main.c`**: The main file that includes `functions.h` and calls the functions.

By separating the functions into another file, you keep `main.c` clean and manageable while still being able to use all of the functions. The header guard ensures that the header is included only once, preventing redefinition errors.
